## Sentiment Analysis Project

The technique of sentiment analysis can be used to determine the emotional undertone of a set of words. It makes it easier to understand the attitudes, emotions, and points of view that are expressed in literature.
It is applied to the analysis of attitudes, feelings, and opinions in textual data. Understanding client comments, evaluations, social media remarks, and more is made easier with this.

For this project, we are working on 2 basic model
  1. SVM with unigram
  2. Naive Bayes

Every member has uploaded their model file & it is found out that SVM is performing better than Naive Bayes
